## üìû Outreach Scripts

### Cold Email Template 1: Pain-Focused

**Subject:** How [Agency Name] can save 10+ hours/week on media planning

```
Hi [Name],

I came across [Agency Name] and was impressed by [specific detail: client roster, case study, award].

Quick question: How much time does your team spend each week on:
‚Ä¢ Creating media plans from scratch
‚Ä¢ Collecting campaign data from multiple platforms
‚Ä¢ Generating client reports

Most agencies we talk to spend 10-15 hours/week on this ‚Äî time that could be spent on strategy and growth.

We built MRM AI to solve exactly this problem. It's the first platform designed specifically for advertising agencies, with:
‚úÖ AI-powered media plan generation (minutes, not hours)
‚úÖ Auto data collection from all ad platforms
‚úÖ One-click client-ready reports

Would you be open to a quick 15-min call to see if we can help [Agency Name] save time and scale faster?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Early adopters get 50% off for 6 months.
```

### Cold Email Template 2: Social Proof

**Subject:** How [Similar Agency] cut reporting time by 70% with MRM AI

```
Hi [Name],

We recently helped [Similar Agency] (also [X] people, managing [Y] clients) reduce their reporting time from 12 hours/week to 3 hours/week.

They were struggling with:
‚Ä¢ Manual data collection from Yandex, Google, VK
‚Ä¢ Creating media plans in Excel (prone to errors)
‚Ä¢ Coordinating across PM, specialists, analysts

Sound familiar?

MRM AI automated all of this for them. Now:
‚úÖ Data auto-syncs daily from all platforms
‚úÖ Media plans generated by AI in 5 minutes
‚úÖ Reports sent to clients with 1 click

Would a 15-min demo be helpful? I can show you exactly how it works with your stack.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. [Similar Agency Quote]: "This saved us 12 hours/week. Best investment we made."
```

### LinkedIn InMail Template

**Subject:** Idea for [Company Name]

## üìû Discovery Call Script (30 min)

### Opening (2 min)

```

Quick intro: I'm [Your Name] from MRM AI. We help advertising agencies automate their workflows ‚Äî media planning, data collection, reporting.

[Wait for yes]

Great! Let me ask a few questions..."
```

---

### Discovery Questions (15 min)

**1. Current Setup:**
"Tell me about your team and workflow."
- How many people on your team?
- How many clients/projects do you manage?
- What tools do you use now? (PM, analytics, media planning)

**2. Pain Points:**
"What's the biggest bottleneck or frustration in your process?"
- [Listen carefully! Take notes]
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "How much time does that take per week?"

**3. Impact:**
"What's the cost of this problem?"
- Lost revenue?
- Team burnout?
- Client dissatisfaction?
- Scaling challenges?

**4. Current Solutions:**
"How are you solving this today?"
- What have you tried?

---

### Mini-Pitch (5 min)

**Only if they're qualified (3/4 BANT)**

```
"Thanks for sharing! Based on what you told me, I think MRM AI could be a great fit.

Here's how we solve [their top 3 pain points]:

1. [Pain 1]: We have [Feature X] that [benefit]
   Example: If you spend 10h/week on data collection, our auto-sync reduces that to 30 minutes.

2. [Pain 2]: Our [Feature Y] handles [benefit]
   Example: AI media plan generator creates plans in 5 minutes vs 6 hours in Excel.

3. [Pain 3]: [Feature Z] means [benefit]
   Example: One-click reports for clients ‚Äî no more copy-paste from 5 different sources.

ROI: Most agencies save 10-15 hours/week, which is $2,000-4,000/month in labor cost.

Does this sound like it could work for you?"
```

---

### Close for Demo (3 min)

```
"Great! The best way to see if this fits is a live demo with your actual data.

I can show you:
‚úÖ How to migrate your existing projects in minutes
‚úÖ How AI generates media plans
‚úÖ How reports look for your clients
‚úÖ Answer any questions

It takes about 30 minutes. Do you have your calendar handy? Let's find a time."

[Book demo on the spot]

"Perfect! I'll send a calendar invite. 

In the meantime:
- Can you send me a sample media plan (Excel/Sheets)? I'll use it in the demo.
- Anyone else should join? (PM, analyst, etc)

Looking forward to showing you this!"
```

---

## üé• Demo Call Script (30 min)

**Goal:** Show value, handle objections, close for trial/purchase

### Pre-Demo Prep

**Before the call:**
- [ ] Review their sample media plan / data
- [ ] Customize demo to their use case
- [ ] Prepare their industry examples
- [ ] Test all features (no bugs during demo!)
- [ ] Have pricing sheet ready

---

### Demo Flow (30 min)

#### 1. Re-State Problems (2 min)

```
"Hi [Name], great to see you!

Quick recap from our last call:
- You're spending [X hours] on [pain 1]
- [Pain 2] is causing [impact]
- You want [desired outcome]

Today I'll show you exactly how MRM AI solves this. Sound good?

[Wait for yes]

I'll share my screen. Feel free to interrupt with questions anytime."
```

---

#### 2. The Wow Moment: Migration Assistant (5 min)

**Goal:** Show instant value

```
"Let me start with the Migration Assistant ‚Äî this is what gets agencies excited.

[Share screen: Upload interface]

See this Excel file? It's your media plan you sent me.

Watch what happens when I upload it...

[Upload, AI processes in 10 seconds]

[Show result: perfectly structured media plan in platform]

There. In 10 seconds, your media plan is now in the system:
‚úì All channels mapped
‚úì Budget allocated
‚úì Dates set
‚úì Ready to go

Most agencies tell us this alone saves them 2-3 hours per project.

Questions so far?"
```

**Pause for reaction (they'll be impressed!)**

---

#### 3. Core Feature 1: AI Media Plan Analyzer (7 min)

```
"Now let's say you have this media plan, and you want to optimize it.

[Click: Analyze button]

The AI looks at:
- Budget allocation across channels
- Frequency and reach calculations
- Historical performance data
- Industry benchmarks

[Show results in 5 seconds]

Here's what it found:
‚Ä¢ 'TV budget is 40% but only reaches 25% of target audience ‚Äî consider shifting 10% to Digital OLV'
‚Ä¢ 'Current frequency is 8.2, which is above optimal (5-7) ‚Äî diminishing returns'
‚Ä¢ 'Adding ‚ÇΩ50K to VK Ads could increase reach by 15% based on your past campaigns'

You can accept these suggestions, reject them, or customize.

Want to see it apply the optimization?

[Click: Apply]

[Show: updated media plan with new allocations]

Boom. What took 2 hours of manual calculation and guesswork ‚Äî done in 30 seconds.

This is using scientific media planning models (Shmatov methodology) under the hood.

Questions?"
```

---

#### 4. Core Feature 2: Auto Data Collection & Reporting (7 min)

```
"Next: reporting. This is where agencies spend 10+ hours/week.

[Navigate to Integrations]

You connect your ad platforms once ‚Äî Yandex Direct, Metrika, VK Ads, Google ‚Äî and we auto-sync data every day.

[Show: Integration dashboard with live data]

Now when you need a report:

[Navigate to Report Generator]

Select:
- Date range: last month
- Metrics: impressions, clicks, CPC, conversions
- Format: client-facing (branded)

[Click: Generate]

[5 seconds later: beautiful PDF report]

[Show report: charts, tables, insights]

And here's the best part ‚Äî see this section?

[Point to AI Insights]

'CTR dropped 15% in week 3. Recommendation: pause underperforming ad groups XYZ and reallocate ‚ÇΩ20K to top performers.'

The AI not only reports the data but tells you what to DO about it.

This report ‚Äî formatted, branded, with insights ‚Äî used to take your analyst 4-5 hours.

Now: 30 seconds.

Questions?"
```

---

#### 5. Core Feature 3: AI Project Assistant (5 min)

```
"Last thing: project management.

[Navigate to Project view]

You can create projects, assign tasks, RACI matrix ‚Äî standard stuff.

But here's where it gets interesting:

[Click: AI Assistant]

You can literally talk to it:

[Type: 'We're launching a new campaign for Client X. Budget: ‚ÇΩ1M. Goal: awareness. Create a project plan.']

[AI generates in 10 seconds:]
- Task breakdown (8 tasks)
- Timeline (4 weeks)
- RACI assignments (based on your team roles)
- Milestones

[Show: Generated project plan]

You can edit, approve, or regenerate.

This is what PMs love ‚Äî it takes the 'blank page' problem away. You start with 80% done, just need to refine.

Questions?"
```

---

#### 6. Wrap-up & Address Their Specific Use Case (3 min)

```
"So to recap, MRM AI helps [Agency Name] with:
‚úÖ [Pain 1] ‚Üí [Feature X] (saves Y hours)
‚úÖ [Pain 2] ‚Üí [Feature Y] (saves Y hours)
‚úÖ [Pain 3] ‚Üí [Feature Z] (saves Y hours)

Total time saved: ~10-15 hours/week

At your team's cost (‚ÇΩ2,000/hour), that's ‚ÇΩ20,000-30,000/month saved.

Our pricing:
- Business plan: ‚ÇΩ9,900/month
- ROI: 2-3x in month 1

Does this make sense for [Agency Name]?"
```

---

### Handle Objections (see next section)

### Close for Trial/Purchase (2 min)

```
"Great! Here's what I recommend:

We have a 14-day free trial ‚Äî no credit card required.

I can set you up today and:
‚úì Help migrate your first 2-3 projects
‚úì Connect your ad platforms
‚úì Train your team (30-min onboarding call)

If not, no hard feelings.

Sound fair?

[Wait for yes]

Perfect! Let me send you the signup link and calendar invite for onboarding.

[Send link in chat]

Any questions before we wrap up?"
```

---

## üö´ Objection Handling Guide

### Objection 1: "We already use [Monday/Asana/etc]"

**Response:**
```
"That's great! Monday/Asana are solid tools.

Here's the difference:
- Monday/Asana are horizontal (work for any industry)
- MRM AI is vertical (built specifically for advertising)

For example:
‚Ä¢ Can Monday auto-generate media plans? No.
‚Ä¢ Can Asana pull data from Yandex Direct and Metrika? No.
‚Ä¢ Does ClickUp have scientific media planning calculators? No.

Think of it this way:
Monday/Asana = Google Docs (general purpose)
MRM AI = Figma for designers (purpose-built)

You wouldn't use Google Docs for design, right?

Most of our clients still use Monday for non-advertising work.
But for advertising projects, MRM AI is 10x better.

Want to see a side-by-side comparison?"
```

---

### Objection 2: "Too expensive / We don't have budget"

**Response:**
```
"I understand budget is tight. Let me show you the ROI:

You mentioned you spend:
- [X hours/week] on data collection
- [Y hours/week] on media planning
- [Z hours/week] on reporting

Total: ~15 hours/week = 60 hours/month

At ‚ÇΩ2,000/hour (conservative estimate), that's ‚ÇΩ120,000/month in labor cost.

MRM AI costs ‚ÇΩ9,900/month and saves 60% of that time.

ROI:
- Cost: ‚ÇΩ9,900/month
- Savings: ‚ÇΩ72,000/month (60% of 120K)
- Net savings: ‚ÇΩ62,000/month

That's 7x ROI in month 1.

Plus: faster turnaround = happier clients = more retention.

The real question isn't 'can we afford it?'
It's 'can we afford NOT to automate?'

What if we start with a 14-day free trial so you can prove the ROI yourself?"
```

---

### Objection 3: "We need to think about it"

**Response:**
```
"Absolutely, big decision!

Before I let you go, can I ask:
What specifically do you need to think about?
- Is it the price?
- Features you're unsure about?
- Need to get approval from someone?
- Want to see more case studies?

[Listen to real objection, address it]

"I totally get it. Here's what I suggest:

How about we do a 14-day free trial (no credit card needed)?

That way you can:
‚úì Test it with your real projects
‚úì Show your team
‚úì Measure actual time savings

At the end of 14 days, if it's not a slam dunk, no problem.

But at least you'll have real data to make the decision.

Fair?"
```

---

### Objection 4: "Can we try it for free longer? 14 days isn't enough"

**Response:**
```
"I hear you ‚Äî 14 days can feel short.

Here's the thing: we've found that agencies who are a good fit know within 7 days.

You'll:
- Migrate 1-2 projects: Day 1 (30 min)
- Generate a media plan: Day 2 (10 min)
- Set up integrations: Day 3 (15 min)
- Create a report: Day 4 (10 min)

By day 5, you'll know if this saves you time.

That said, if you need more time to test with your team, I can extend to 21 days.

But I need a commitment from you:
- You'll actually use it (not just sign up and forget)
- You'll have a decision by day 21

Deal?"
```

---

### Objection 5: "We'll build it ourselves / We have dev team"

**Response:**
```
"That's ambitious! A few things to consider:

1. **Time to market:**
   - Building this took us 12 months with 8 engineers.
   - You'd need: backend, frontend, AI specialist, integrations, QA.
   - Timeline: 12-18 months minimum.

2. **Cost:**
   - 8 engineers √ó $8K/month √ó 12 months = $768K
   - vs MRM AI: $10K/month = $120K/year

3. **Opportunity cost:**
   - What else could your dev team be building?
   - Revenue-generating features? Client-facing tools?

4. **Ongoing maintenance:**
   - Ad platform APIs change constantly (Yandex, Google, VK)
   - You'd need dedicated team to maintain integrations.

5. **AI complexity:**
   - Training LLMs, managing prompts, RAG systems ‚Äî highly specialized.

Most agencies realize:
'This is not our core competency. Let's focus on serving clients, not building software.'

But I get it ‚Äî you want control and customization.

What if you:
- Use MRM AI for 80% of needs (off-the-shelf)
- Build custom integrations for your unique workflows (via our API)

We have an Enterprise plan with:
‚úì API access
‚úì Custom integrations
‚úì White-label option

Want to explore that?"
```

---

### Objection 6: "We're worried about AI making mistakes"

**Response:**
```
"Totally valid concern! AI is powerful but not perfect.

Here's how we handle this:

1. **Human-in-the-loop:**
   - AI generates suggestions (media plans, insights, tasks)
   - YOU review and approve before execution
   - Think of AI as a smart assistant, not autopilot

2. **Confidence scores:**
   - AI shows confidence level for each suggestion
   - Low confidence? It flags it for your review

3. **Edit everything:**
   - All AI outputs are editable
   - You have full control

4. **Audit trail:**
   - Every change is logged
   - You can see what AI suggested vs what you approved

5. **Learning from feedback:**
   - When you edit AI output, it learns and improves

Real-world example:
- Agency X uses MRM AI for 6 months
- AI generates 100 media plans
- 85 approved as-is
- 15 edited (minor tweaks)
- 0 rejected (major errors)

85% time savings with 100% accuracy (after review).

The key: AI does the heavy lifting, you do the QA.

Want to see how the review workflow works in the demo?"
